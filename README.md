Find out who is no longer at your company by checking who currently has a Hipchat account.

This was started as a goof because sometimes it's useful to know if someone you're trying to get in touch with is still with the company.

You'll need the HypChat library (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hypchat/) to get this up and running. You'll also need your own API key from Hipchat.

This could be improved: not storing the API key in the code directly and unencrypted, and not storing people's names unencrypted locally.

Usefulness of this is not guaranteed, I'm not liable if this doesn't work (or even if it does work), and if something happens to your computer or to you as a result of running this, it's your dime. Use at your own risk.
